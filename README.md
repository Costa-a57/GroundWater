Turbo Basic code: PARTICLE, Author: Costantino Masciopinto, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Ricerca Sulle Acque, Bari (I) 
2D numerical solution of the pollutant transport in a fracture with a variable aperture. The solution is provided for a regular lattice of channels. Every channel has a length dx or dy and cross-section dy * nodal aperture or dx * nodal aperture 
Input data requirements:
The topology of the channel network, for example, channel 1, from node 1 to node 2, etc.    
Horizontal fluid flow solution, i.e. fluid velocity in each channel of the grid.
The software asks other input during running. 
This software requires the executable file RANPESA.EXE, which estimates the random number. The input of the latter code requires the file name “prob.dat” in the same directory.
